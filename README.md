# 3D-Scene
How do I approach designing software?
When I approach software I first view the project holistically; what should the final code generally look like? What methods and classes are most important? Prepare the framework then build the methods. Plan where and why each method needs to be called and ensure they interact properly. 
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project was completely new to me. I had never worked with OpenGL or made a 3d scene before. Working on it has given me the most basic skills in both these regards as well as showing me the value of working on things piece by piece. 
What design process did you follow for your project work?
The nature of the project was iterative and involved a lot of trial and error. Whenever an object was placed into the scene I approximated its position and then worked from there adjusting the various transformations until it looked right. Every week a new piece of the puzzle was introduced, attempted, and improved upon for the final product. 
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The tactics from this project can be applied to any future work I do that is open ended in nature. Creativity and logical thinking is necessary for most projects but when the final result is from one's own mind instead of that of an employer it becomes more important to view every small change one makes on the entire software. 
How do I approach developing programs?
Developing a program is much the same as developing software. The program comes together in an iterative and modular fashion. 
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Approximation and trial and error was a huge part of crafting the 3d scene. Placing objects relative to other ones was a constant process along with adjusting transformations to make the scene look similar to the reference image. 
How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was the biggest factor throughout the project. Each week brought a new piece of the puzzle that would eventually become the polished 3d scene. With each new object added there was a new point for each of the other objects to reference in both size and position. 
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
The milestone structure of the project showed me the value of ensuring one goal at a time functions perfectly before trying to move on to the next. 
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science shows the value of logic and taking things step by step. Executing a program is no different than achieving a goal. One must take logical steps that ultimately lead to whatever it is they are trying to accomplish. 
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Future courses will likely require the use of visualization beyond work in a simple terminal as they have up to this point. I imagine that soon my projects will require tangible, visual results that even a layaman can point out. 
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
The goal of my educational path in computer science is to naturally transform it into a professional one. Everything I learn in my courses and every project I complete is necessary to build skills that I intend to use in my career. The goal is to work in software development, so every project and assignment worked on for every course I take is invaluable experience.
